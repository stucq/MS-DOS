MS-DOS Reverse Engineering Project
==================================

The goal of this project is to reverse engineer MS-DOS in its various iterations
and versions without relying on leaked betas or source code. As such, this is
fully legal, clean-room reverse engineering.

Currently, the disassembly in progress is that of 86-DOS 1.00.
